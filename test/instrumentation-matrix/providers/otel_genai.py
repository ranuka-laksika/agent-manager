"""OTel-GenAI-native provider.

Exercises the current OpenTelemetry GenAI semantic conventions as emitted by
OTel-native SDKs (e.g. Microsoft Agent Framework and the OpenAI .NET SDK):
span names shaped ``{operation} {model}`` (e.g. ``chat gpt-4o-mini``),
``gen_ai.provider.name`` rather than the legacy ``gen_ai.system``, structured
``parts[]`` messages, and ``gen_ai.tool.call.*`` tool I/O.

The .NET external-agent sample (``samples/dotnet-agent/``) emits exactly this
shape. This provider re-expresses it in Python so the shape is locked into the
compatibility matrix and validated against the same contract bundle the observer
reads. It is emission-only (no init-container / instrumentationVersions), like
the ``manual`` provider. See ``harness/classify.py`` — the classifier already
recognises this semconv.
