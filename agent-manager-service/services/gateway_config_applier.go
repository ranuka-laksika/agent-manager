// GatewayConfigApplier patches the gateway runtime configuration (the source of
// truth) when an identity provider changes. The AMS mirror row alone is not enough:
// agent OAuth deploy-time validation reads the mirror, so a mirror-only issuer passes
// validation while the gateway rejects its tokens at runtime (see the warning on
// UpsertGatewayIdentityProvider). An applier closes that gap by updating the gateway
// before the mirror is written.
//
// In open-source deployments this is nil and the gateway config is applied out of band
// by deployments/scripts/manage-identity-provider.sh. Cloud deployments inject an
// implementation (via app.Options) that patches the per-environment gateway config
// server-side, so a single API request keeps the gateway and the mirror in sync.
//
// Implementations must be idempotent: an upsert is keyed by provider name and a delete
// is a no-op when the provider is absent, so a client retry after a partial failure
// re-converges. Validation of the provider (issuer/JWKS, OIDC discovery, system-provider
// guards) happens in the OSS layer before the applier is called; the applier does not
// re-validate and only ever receives custom providers.
