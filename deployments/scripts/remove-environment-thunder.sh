# Removes the dedicated Thunder ID instance for ONE environment.
# Mirrors add-environment-thunder.sh — call this before removing the environment itself.
#
# All inputs are provided via environment variables so the script can be piped
# directly into bash:
#
#   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wso2/agent-manager/main/deployments/scripts/remove-environment-thunder.sh \
#     | ENV_NAME=staging \

# Re-running is idempotent: if the release or namespace is already gone the step
# is skipped gracefully.

# Required:
#   - ENV_NAME: the environment name (lowercase alphanumeric with hyphens)
# Optional:
#   - ORG_NAME (default: default)
#   Best-effort cleanup of the system-client credential agent-manager-service
#   (AMS) stores in its own database (see add-environment-thunder.sh's
#   store_via_ams) — failure here does NOT abort this script, since environment
#   teardown must succeed even if AMS is unreachable; an orphaned row is
#   harmless (it's only ever read by ouId+env, and a deleted environment's name
#   is not expected to be reused for a Thunder instance with different secrets).
#   AMS looks the row up by this token's own OU ID (never client-supplied), so
#   the DELETE only removes the right row when this token belongs to the same
#   OU add-environment-thunder.sh ran as for this environment.
#   - AMP_API_URL (default: http://localhost:9000/api/v1)
#   - AGENT_MANAGER_TOKEN (default: unset) — if unset, obtains one via
#     client_credentials against IDP_TOKEN_URL/IDP_CLIENT_ID/IDP_CLIENT_SECRET
#     (defaults: http://thunder.amp.localhost:8080/oauth2/token, amp-api-client,
#     amp-api-client-secret) — same identity add-environment-thunder.sh uses.
